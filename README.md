            - Convert from British Pounds to the currency of your country

# Extra:
As an extra challenge we encourage you to let your creativity flow, if I can convert currencies, maybe I can add other types of conversions like temperature for example to my program?
It's time to surprise our client with a feature they may not even have known they needed.
